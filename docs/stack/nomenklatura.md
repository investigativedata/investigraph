# Nomenklatura

Nomenklatura de-duplicates and integrates different [Follow the Money](https://followthemoney.tech) entities. It serves to clean up messy data and to find links between different datasets.

Nomenklatura is mainly developed by [Friedrich Lindenberg](https://pudo.org), founder of [OpenSanctions](https://opensanctions.org)

**investigraph** uses Nomenklatura as a foundation to model [catalogs](../concepts/catalog.md), [datasets](../concepts/dataset.md) and [entities](../concepts/entity.md).
