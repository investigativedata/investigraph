# Follow The Money

FollowTheMoney (FtM) is a data model for anti-corruption investigations. It contains definitions of the entities relevant in such research (like *people* or *companies*) and tools that let you generate, validate, and export such data easily. *Entities* can reference each other, thus creating a graph of *relationships*.

FtM is developed by the [Organized Crime and Corruption Project (OCCRP)](https://occrp.org).

FtM can be used in three contexts: as a *command-line utility*, a *Python library*, and as a *TypeScript/JavaScript* library. The ontology defined by FtM also includes a model for various types of documents that might be used as evidence in investigations.

**investigraph** uses FtM to model and parse [entities](../../concepts/entity).
