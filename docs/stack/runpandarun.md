# Run Panda Run

`runpandarun` is a simple interface written in python for reproducible i/o workflows around tabular data via [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) `DataFrame` specified as `yaml` "playbooks".

Development of this library was paused in 2020 but is now active again with the support of [Media Tech Lab Bayern batch #3](https://github.com/media-tech-lab), as it became the core foundation for the extraction stage of **investigraph**.
